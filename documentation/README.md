# Submission Guidelines for TREC AutoJudge

We aim to encourage code submissions so that submitted AutoJudge systems run within TIRA and also can be easily re-executed by others.
It usually requires more effort to organize code so that it runs on machines that are not under your control.
In case you want to make a code submission, we encourage you to organize your code of your approach via pull requests into this repository as this allows us to help you in the progress and also ensures that we can collect all code-submissions in one place.
We also allow to manually upload submissions in cases when code submissions are not useful (e.g., for human-created leaderboards or highly experimental systems that do not justify the additional effort to have well-organized code).

## Run Uploads

To support manual submissions and experimental submissions that do not fit well into code submissions, we support the upload of submissions.
