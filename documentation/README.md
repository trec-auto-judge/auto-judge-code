# Submission Guidelines for TREC AutoJudge

We encourage code submissions so that AutoJudge systems can be re-executed by others.
Organizing code so that it runs on machines that are not under your control requires more effort (please consider to add the code of your approach via a pull request to this repository as this allows us to provide help and maintain everything in one place).
We also allow to [manually upload submissions](#submission-variant-1-upload-of-submissions).
